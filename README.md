# QUCK_SORT ON THE MY TASK!
On this repository, i decided to I decided to add an example of a task where quick sort can be used!
## WARNING:
This code was developed using my method, you can use yours (I didn’t use classes, I decided to use and practice more on structures). if you want to use your own method, no one forbids you. Thank you!

# ABOUT QUICK SORT:
How, you know the Quick Sort - very popular, and and a fairly effective method for solving complex problems. One of the fastest known general-purpose array sorting algorithms: on average, O(n log ⁡n) swaps when sorting n elements; due to a number of shortcomings, it is usually used with some modifications in practice.
# EXAMPLE

Worst time: O(n^2).

Best time: O(n log n) (regular division).

or O(n) (split into 3 parts).

Average time: O(n log n).

Memory cost O(n) auxiliary.
